# Property based testing support

There is a support for property based testing through the `cornichon-check` module.

The initial inspiration came after reading the following article [Property based integration testing using Haskell!](https://functional.works-hub.com/learn/property-based-integration-testing-using-haskell-6c25c) which describes a way to tackle the problem of property based testing for HTTP APIs.

Although the implementations are clearly different due to the `cornichon` and Scala concepts; this article remains a great introduction to the problem we are trying to solve with `cornichon-check`.
